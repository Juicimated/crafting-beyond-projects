This is just a mod I'm developing for a personal server of mine!

Currently includes God Residue (a resource dropped periodically by operator players), Godballs (a material crafted with God Residue), Belle Rods (a rod variant dropped by Endermen when sheared), and the Staff of Kindness (a staff that creates a "friendly zone" around you on use).

Will be updated over time to suit the server's needs (mostly lore).
